With this data we can draw analysis based on specific filtering or overall monitoring:
1. A selection of project and project type can be seen which will help with analytics on basis of specific project combinations
2. Region-wise project cost and benefits is shown in the pie chart with the total sum
3. Phase wise segregation of projects can be seen as well
4. Project summary has been shown as a table for further information
5. Segregation of projects (as a count) for each manager is shown as a barchart
6. Individual KPI values on cost reduction, income generation,working capital and process improvement values



The template can be used in your own dashboard by downloading the file with "pbit" extension
